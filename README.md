## 1. Introduction

The rise of convincing deepfakes presents a significant threat to the financial sector. Malicious actors can use AI-generated video and audio to impersonate executives and authorize fraudulent transactions (a technique known as CEO fraud), spread misinformation to manipulate stock prices, or bypass biometric security checks.

This project provides a Jupyter Notebook that implements a foundational AI solution for deepfake detection. It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to identify the subtle digital artifacts and unnatural noise patterns that often differentiate AI-generated images from real ones.

## 2. The Solution Explained: CNN for Artifact Detection

The core premise of this solution is that the process of generating a deepfake leaves behind faint but detectable traces, much like digital fingerprints. Our model is designed to learn and identify these traces.

### 2.1 The "Tell": Simulating Deepfake Artifacts

Real-world deepfake detection models are trained on massive datasets of real and fake videos. To create a self-contained and educational example, this notebook **synthetically generates** its own dataset that mimics this principle:
*   **"Real" Images:** These are generated by adding a layer of smooth, random noise (like Perlin or Gaussian noise) to a base image. This simulates the natural noise profile from a real camera's sensor.
*   **"Deepfake" Images:** These are generated by adding a structured, periodic noise pattern (like a faint, high-frequency checkerboard or sine wave). This simulates the systematic, unnatural artifacts that can be introduced by a generative AI model (like a GAN or a diffusion model).

The model's challenge is to learn to distinguish between these two types of noise, ignoring the underlying base image content.

### 2.2 The AI Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

We use a CNN, the industry standard for image classification tasks, built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.
*   **How it Works:** CNNs apply a series of filters (kernels) to an image to automatically learn and identify hierarchical patterns. In the early layers, they might learn to detect simple edges and textures. In deeper layers, they can combine these to recognize more complex features.
*   **Our Goal:** In this specific problem, the CNN learns that the "texture" of the periodic noise is a key indicator of a fake, while the texture of the random noise indicates a real image.

### 2.3 Evaluation

In a security context, the cost of a mistake is not symmetrical. A **False Negative** (classifying a deepfake as "real") is extremely dangerous, while a **False Positive** (classifying a real image as "fake") is an inconvenience. We evaluate our model using:
*   **Accuracy:** The overall percentage of correct predictions.
*   **Confusion Matrix:** A table that breaks down the model's performance, showing the exact number of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives. This is critical for understanding the model's real-world reliability.
*   **Precision and Recall:** Metrics that measure the model's performance on the positive (deepfake) class.

## 3. How to Use the Notebook

### 3.1. Prerequisites

This project uses the TensorFlow deep learning library, along with standard data science packages.

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### 3.2. Running the Notebook

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shrikarak/deepfake-detection-ai-finance.git
    cd deepfake-detection-ai-finance
    ```
2.  Start the Jupyter server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Open `deepfake_detector.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially. The notebook will generate the synthetic dataset, build and train the CNN, and display the evaluation results.

## 4. Deployment and Real-World Application

This notebook provides a foundational template for a deepfake detection service.

1.  **Deployment as an API:** The trained model would be saved and deployed as an API endpoint.
2.  **Integration:** In a financial institution, this API could be integrated into various workflows:
    *   **Video Verification:** Before processing a large wire transfer requested via video call, frames from the video could be sent to the API for analysis. A "deepfake" prediction would immediately halt the transaction and trigger a manual review.
    *   **Identity Verification:** During a "Know Your Customer" (KYC) video onboarding process, the model could analyze the video feed to ensure the person is real and not a deepfake impersonator.
3.  **Using Real Data:** For a production system, this model would not be trained on synthetic data. It would be trained on large-scale, real-world deepfake datasets like **FaceForensics++** or the **Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)** dataset to learn the artifacts produced by state-of-the-art generative models.
